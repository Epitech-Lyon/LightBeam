=================================

riscv64 implementation for embedded system.

Reference of [riscv common](../..).

[Official sifive spec](https://sifive.cdn.prismic.io/sifive%2F834354f0-08e6-423c-bf1f-0cb58ef14061_fu540-c000-v1.0.pdf)

There are no multi-level bootloading in our implementation.

The code start at `0x80000000` and we don't use the two previous stages.

Sifive havn't any integrated graphical interface, then we are using the UART.
