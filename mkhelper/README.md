# Build philosophy

The build is assured by a builder present at `builder/builder.mk` callable from everywhere.

## Work with this builder in a Makefile

Define Some Variable:

  - `BUILDER_HEADER`    : The header wich will be print before the build
  - `BUILDER_TYPE`      : The type of our build output [ *static library* | *binary & img* | *no link* | *ISO (x86 GRUB only)* ]
  - `BUILDER_TARGET`    : The output name (in case of library or binary output type)
  - `BUILDER_SOURCE_DIR`: The sources directories we want to compile

Then include the builder file & call the `lauchbuilder` rule.

The builder assume `C` & `Assembly` source file compilation.

All The object file will be relocated to the `build/` directory at project root with their total path form `src/`.

## Build a kernel

Using the root Makefile: `make TARGET=$PLATEFORM`.

Plateform are listed [here](../src/target/README.md).
